My name is Chris(Zhizhou) Zhang.\
I am a software engineer of [Programming System Team](https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/science/) at Uber.\
I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) advised by [Prof. Tim Sherwood](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/prof-sherwood) at [ArchLab](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/).
I also closely collaborated with [Prof. Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/).
Before that, I received my undergrad degree from the University of Rochester working with [Prof. Chen Ding](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cding/).

My research interests include computer architecture, compilers, Operating Systems, and Microservices.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and playing violin.
