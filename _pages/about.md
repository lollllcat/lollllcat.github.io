My name is Chris (Zhizhou) Zhang. I am a software engineer at [Programming System Team](https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/science/) at Uber. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) advised by [Prof. Tim Sherwood](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/prof-sherwood) at [ArchLab](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/). I also closely collaborated with [Prof. Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/). Before that, I received my undergrad degree from University of Rochester working with [Prof. Chen Ding](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cding/).

My research interests include computer architecture, compiler, Operating System, and Microservices.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and playing violin.
